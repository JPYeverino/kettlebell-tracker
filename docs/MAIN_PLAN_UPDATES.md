# Kettlebell Fat-Loss & Strength Plan (to ~28% by end of March)

## Core Goals
- Drop from ~33% → ~28% body fat with a **moderate deficit** (≈600–750 kcal/day; ~2,050–2,200 kcal for you) while keeping or gaining lean mass.[21][52]  
- Use kettlebell programs (C&P, Snatch, TGU, Clubs, Abs) + simple leg work.

## Program Roles

- **Clean & Press (C&P) program**
  - Role: Main **strength / muscle-preservation** engine (upper + some trunk).[89][101]
  - Frequency: **2×/week**.
  - Load: Start at **16 kg** for ladders until you can complete all prescribed sets at RPE ~7–8, then progress to 18 kg, etc.[105][107]
  - Programming: Follow Wildman ladders as written:
    - 3×(3‑2‑1) → 4×(3‑2‑1) → 5×(3‑2‑1) → 3×(4‑3‑2‑1) → etc.
  - Always done **first in the session** on its days.

- **Snatch EMOM program**
  - Role: Primary **conditioning / calorie burn** while still muscle-friendly.[53][65]
  - Frequency: **2×/week (non-consecutive)** as written; optional short “top‑up” once more if recovered.
  - Load: ≈40–60% of C&P bell.[65][69]
  - Progression: Volume cycles (more minutes at 5/5 EMOM) → density cycles (more reps/min) → heavier bell.[69][81]
  - Effort: RPE ~7–8; breathing hard but technique crisp.[105][107]

- **TGU program (Levels 1–5 + heavy/light)**
  - Role: **Skill, stability, accessory strength, shoulder/hip robustness.**[68][71][77]
  - Frequency: **1–2×/week.**
  - Structure: 28 min, 30s work / 30s rest across 4 rounds × 7 exercises (deconstructed TGU).
  - Full TGUs:
    - Added on some TGU days: 3–5×1–3/side with moderate bell, RPE 7–8.
  - Emphasis: Control > load; supports heavy C&P and snatch work.[68][80]

- **Single‑Arm Club program**
  - Role: **Skill / joint health / rotational strength.**[72][81]
  - Frequency: **1×/week** during the cut.
  - Intensity: Light–moderate (RPE 5–7), 20–30 min.
  - Priority: Accessory – keep it easy enough not to interfere with recovery from C&P + snatch.

- **Leg work (no formal program)**
  - Role: **Strength & longevity.** Strong legs are associated with lower mortality and better functional aging.[85][86][96]
  - Heavy bilateral:
    - Exercise: Goblet or front‑rack squat.
    - Day: Same as heavy C&P.
    - Volume: 3–4×6–10 at RPE 7–8.[89][95]
    - Load: Currently ~20 kg; progress when 4×8 feels solid twice in a row.
  - Unilateral:
    - Exercise: Reverse lunge or Bulgarian split squat.
    - Day: Same as TGU.
    - Volume: 2–3×8–12/leg at RPE 7.
    - Load: Start with 16–20 kg; add reps then weight.

- **5‑Minute Ab Program**
  - Role: **Daily core variation for resilience and transfer to “fight/athletic” patterns.** The program rotates core movements to keep the trunk engaged for other lifting and reduce injury risk.[conversation_history:1]
  - Frequency: Up to **5×/week**, tacked on after main work.
