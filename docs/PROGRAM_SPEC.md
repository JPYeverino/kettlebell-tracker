# Kettlebell Fat-Loss & Strength Plan (to ~28% by end of March)

## Core Goals
- Drop from ~33% → ~28% body fat with a **moderate deficit** (≈600–750 kcal/day; ~2,050–2,200 kcal for you) while keeping or gaining lean mass.
- Use kettlebell programs (C&P, Snatch, TGU, Clubs) + simple leg work.

---

## Program Roles

### Clean & Press (C&P) program
- **Role:** Main **strength / muscle-preservation** engine (upper + some trunk).
- **Frequency:** 2×/week.
- **Load:** Start at **16 kg** for ladders until you can complete all prescribed sets at RPE ~7–8, then progress to 18 kg, etc.
- **Programming:** Follow Wildman ladders as written:
  - 3×(3‑2‑1) → 4×(3‑2‑1) → 5×(3‑2‑1) → 3×(4‑3‑2‑1) → etc.
- Always done **first in the session** on its days.

### Snatch EMOM program
- **Role:** Primary **conditioning / calorie burn** while still muscle-friendly.
- **Frequency:** 2×/week (non-consecutive) as written; optional short "top‑up" once more if recovered.
- **Load:** ≈40–60% of C&P bell.
- **Progression:** Volume cycles (more minutes at 5/5 EMOM) → density cycles (more reps/min) → heavier bell.
- **Effort:** RPE ~7–8; breathing hard but technique crisp.

### TGU program (Levels 1–5 + heavy/light)
- **Role:** Skill, stability, accessory strength, shoulder/hip robustness.
- **Frequency:** 1–2×/week.
- **Structure:** 28 min, 30s work / 30s rest across 4 rounds × 7 exercises (deconstructed TGU).
- **Full TGUs:**
  - Added on some TGU days: 3–5×1–3/side with moderate bell, RPE 7–8.
- **Emphasis:** Control > load; supports heavy C&P and snatch work.

### Single‑Arm Club program
- **Role:** Skill / joint health / rotational strength.
- **Frequency:** 1×/week during the cut.
- **Intensity:** Light–moderate (RPE 5–7), 20–30 min.
- **Priority:** Accessory – keep it easy enough not to interfere with recovery from C&P + snatch.

### Leg work (no formal program)
- **Role:** Strength & longevity.
- **Heavy bilateral:**
  - Exercise: Goblet or front‑rack squat.
  - Day: Same as heavy C&P.
  - Volume: 3–4×6–10 at RPE 7–8.
  - Load: Currently ~20 kg; progress when 4×8 feels solid twice in a row.
- **Unilateral:**
  - Exercise: Reverse lunge or Bulgarian split squat.
  - Day: Same as TGU.
  - Volume: 2–3×8–12/leg at RPE 7.
  - Load: Start with 16–20 kg; add reps then weight.

## RPE Cheat Sheet (Intensity Gauge)

- **RPE 10:** Max; no reps left.
- **RPE 9:** Very hard; ≈1 rep in reserve.
- **RPE 8:** Hard; ≈2 reps in reserve (target for most strength sets).
- **RPE 7:** Challenging but comfortable; ≈3 reps in reserve (good for early progression, legs, skill work).
- **RPE 6 and below:** Easy–moderate; warm‑ups/technique.

## 5‑Day Weekly "Tetris"

### Day 1 – Heavy C&P + Squats (Strength Anchor)
- C&P program **day A** (16 kg ladder at your current step).
- Goblet/front‑rack squats 3–4×6–10 (20 kg, RPE 7–8).
- Optional light core.

### Day 2 – Snatch EMOM (Main Conditioning)
- Snatch EMOM volume/density workout (per program).
- Optional walking/mobility.

### Day 3 – TGU + Unilateral Legs (Skill + Legs)
- TGU Level session (28‑min 30/30).
- Every other week: add full TGUs 3–5×1–3/side afterward.
- Reverse lunges or split squats 2–3×8–12/leg (16–20 kg).

### Day 4 – C&P Volume / Second Strength Hit
- C&P program **day B** (same weight, different ladder step).
- Optional: light goblet squats or RDLs 2×10–12 (technique focus).

### Day 5 – Clubs + Optional Light Conditioning
- Single‑arm clubs: current skill package, 20–30 min, easy–moderate.
- If feeling fresh: short, easy snatch EMOM (e.g., 6–8 min) or a light TGU round.

**Days 6–7:** rest, walking, mobility, sleep.

## Progression Rules (Simple)

- **C&P:** Let the ladder steps dictate progression. Move up when you can finish the current step with good form at RPE ≤8.
- **Squats:** When you can do 4×8 at a given weight with RPE ≤7–8 twice, add a bit of weight or reps.
- **Unilateral legs:** Build to 3×12/leg, then increase weight and drop back to 2×8–10.
- **Snatch:** Follow program (add minutes → reps/min → weight).
- **TGU & Clubs:** Progress slowly—slightly more reps or slightly heavier bell only once technique feels rock‑solid.

---

## Nutrition Guardrails (to match the training)

- **Daily calories:** ≈2,050–2,200 (about 600–750 below your ~2,800 maintenance).
- **Protein:** 210–240 g/day, spread over 4–6 meals.
- **Carbs** biased toward snatch and leg days; fats a bit higher on lighter/skill days.

This keeps the kettlebell programs intact as designed, assigns each a clear role (strength, conditioning, skill, joint health), and gives you a concrete 5‑day schedule plus simple progression rules for the March body‑fat goal.
